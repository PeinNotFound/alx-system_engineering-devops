# 🛠 Web Application Outage Incident Postmortem

## 📅 Issue Summary

- **🕒 Duration:** The outage occurred from 2024-08-10 14:30 UTC to 2024-08-10 15:45 UTC.
- **⚠️ Impact:** 
  - Our web app’s dashboard and user data retrieval features decided to take an unscheduled break.
  - 60% of users saw spinning wheels or got stuck in a loading screen loop. Talk about a not-so-cool user experience!
  - **Root Cause:** A sneaky memory leak in the session handling code turned our server into a memory-hungry monster. 

## 📜 Timeline

- **14:30 UTC:** Monitoring system blares a siren – server performance hits rock bottom.
- **14:35 UTC:** Engineering team dives into server logs, spotting memory allocation errors like a hawk.
- **14:45 UTC:** Initial suspect: recent update to the data processing module. Rollback initiated.
- **15:00 UTC:** Rollback fails. Memory consumption keeps climbing like an out-of-control elevator.
- **15:10 UTC:** Team finds the real culprit – a memory leak in the session handling component.
- **15:20 UTC:** Backend team is called in for a deep dive. They’re on it like a detective on a hot case.
- **15:35 UTC:** Memory leak patched. Server starts breathing normally again.
- **15:45 UTC:** System restored. Users can now access their dashboards without resorting to throwing their devices out the window.

## 🔍 Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:** Our session handling code had a memory leak – it was gobbling up memory like a teenager with snacks. As memory piled up, the server couldn’t keep up and crashed.
- **Resolution:** The backend team hunted down the rogue code, patched the leak, and got the server back in shape. It was like fixing a leaky faucet but with more code.

## 🚀 Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Perform regular code reviews focusing on memory management – no more surprise leaks!
  - Enhance monitoring to spot memory leaks before they crash the party.
- **Action Items:**
  1. **🔍 Code Review:** Set up a detailed review of the session handling code. No more sneaky leaks!
  2. **📊 Monitoring Enhancements:** Add alerts for high memory usage – the earlier, the better.
  3. **🧪 Automated Testing:** Create automated tests for memory usage. Because who likes manual testing?
  4. **📚 Team Training:** Conduct a session on memory management best practices. Knowledge is power!

## 📈 Future Enhancements

To avoid future disasters, we’ll beef up our safeguards and monitoring systems. We’re on it like a superhero squad!
