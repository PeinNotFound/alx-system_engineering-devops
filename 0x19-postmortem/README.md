# 🛠 Database Outage Incident Postmortem

## 📅 Issue Summary

- **🕒 Duration:** 2024-07-12 09:00 UTC to 2024-07-12 12:45 UTC
- **⚠️ Impact:** 
  - 90% of application services were unavailable, affecting data retrieval and transaction processing.
  - Users encountered error messages and were unable to complete new transactions, leading to a significant drop in user satisfaction and potential revenue loss.
- **📝 Root Cause:** An automated deployment introduced an incompatible database schema change, causing cascading failures across multiple services.

## 📜 Timeline

- **09:00 UTC:** Monitoring system alerts the team to a spike in database query failures and increased latency.
- **09:10 UTC:** Engineering team begins investigating database server health and performance metrics.
- **09:30 UTC:** Errors in application logs indicate schema mismatches during data queries.
- **09:45 UTC:** Automated deployment identified as the source of the schema changes, leading to incompatibilities with existing application code.
- **10:00 UTC:** Rollback attempt fails due to partial schema changes already applied.
- **11:00 UTC:** Database and application teams manually revert schema changes and restore functionality.
- **12:00 UTC:** Database services partially restored; transaction processing still offline.
- **12:45 UTC:** Full resolution achieved after reverting all schema changes and updating the application code for compatibility.

## 🔍 Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:** The automated deployment process introduced a schema change without verifying compatibility with the existing application code, leading to widespread service failures.
- **Resolution:** Manual reversion of schema changes and updates to the deployment process to prevent future incompatibility issues.

## 🚀 Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement a robust deployment process with automated schema compatibility checks.
  - Enhance staging environment to more closely mirror production for better pre-deployment testing.
- **Action Items:**
  1. **Pre-Deployment Checks:** Integrate schema compatibility checks into the deployment pipeline.
  2. **Comprehensive Testing:** Develop test suites to simulate real-world usage scenarios and ensure no impact on service availability.
  3. **Improved Communication:** Enhance communication between teams to ensure awareness of database changes and potential risks.
  4. **Regular Reviews:** Schedule regular review meetings to analyze recent deployments and identify areas for process improvement.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

To ensure the resilience of our systems, we will be implementing additional safeguards and enhancing our monitoring capabilities to detect and mitigate similar issues more effectively.
