# 🛠 Web Application Outage Incident Postmortem

## 📅 Issue Summary

- **🕒 Duration:** The outage occurred from 2024-08-10 14:30 UTC to 2024-08-10 15:45 UTC.
- **⚠️ Impact:** 
  - The web application’s dashboard and user data retrieval features were unavailable.
  - 60% of users experienced either slow response times or complete failures when attempting to load their dashboards.
  - The root cause was an unexpected memory leak in the application server, which led to server crashes under high load.

## 📜 Timeline

- **14:30 UTC:** Issue detected via automated monitoring alerts showing a spike in server response times and error rates.
- **14:35 UTC:** The engineering team began investigating the server logs, noticing repeated memory allocation errors.
- **14:45 UTC:** Initial assumption was that a recent update to the data processing module caused the issue; the team began rolling back the update.
- **15:00 UTC:** Rolling back the update did not resolve the issue; further investigation revealed a significant increase in memory usage over time.
- **15:10 UTC:** The team identified a potential memory leak in the session handling component of the application.
- **15:20 UTC:** Incident escalated to the backend engineering team for a deep dive into the session management code.
- **15:35 UTC:** The backend team identified and patched the memory leak.
- **15:45 UTC:** The patched version was deployed, and the system was fully restored.

## 🔍 Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:** The issue was caused by a memory leak in the session handling component of the application. The memory leak occurred due to improper memory management when handling user sessions, causing the server to consume more memory over time until it crashed under heavy load.
- **Resolution:** The backend engineering team identified the faulty code responsible for the memory leak and applied a patch to fix the memory allocation issue. Once the patch was deployed, the system’s performance returned to normal, and users were able to access the application without issues.

## 🚀 Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Conduct a thorough code review focusing on memory management practices in the application.
  - Enhance monitoring to detect memory leaks early, including setting up alerts for unusual memory usage patterns.
- **Action Items:**
  1. **🔍 Code Review:** Schedule a comprehensive review of the session handling code to ensure no further memory issues are present.
  2. **📊 Monitoring Enhancements:** Implement additional monitoring for memory usage and set thresholds for alerts when memory consumption exceeds normal levels.
  3. **🧪 Automated Testing:** Develop and integrate automated tests that specifically target memory usage during the QA process.
  4. **📚 Team Training:** Organize a training session for the development team on best practices for memory management in high-load environments.
